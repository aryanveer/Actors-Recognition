# Actor Recognition and Screen Time Calculation

## Calculating the Screen Time

1. Import and read the video, extract frames from it, and save them as images.
2. Label a few images for training the model.
3. Build our model on training data.
4. Make predictions for the remaining images.
5. Calculate the screen time of the actors.


## Actor Recognition

1. Detecting a face using haarcascade
2. Forming a square around any face detected.
3. Enter id for every different face and gather images of faces.
4. Train on the basis of gathered data
5. Here I am using Local Binary Pattern Histograms Algorithm
6. Providing a different video section and recognizing the actor by name
